# Pockit Tech

## Who are we
At Pockit we're on a mission to build a bank for the 8 million people in the UK who have been left behind by traditional banks. We're looking for talented engineers to help further this vision in a fair and transparent way.

We currently offer a prepaid contactless Mastercard, which comes with a unique account number and sortcode to receive bank transfers. Customers can send money to both UK and international accounts, and spend in any of the millions of shops that accept Mastercard worldwide. Our website and mobile apps give easy access to their accounts, with more features being added weekly.

Our goal is to roll out a suite of polished financial services to those who, until now, have been neglected by the banking world. Naturally, this presents a whole host of challenges and tough technical problems (if it was easy, it would have been done already!), with ambitious timelines to match.

We care about building a platform that works for everyone. There's always room for improvement when it comes to reliability, scale and performance, and we strive to:

- Build bug-free features and products.
- Build a platform which can scale to meet the demand brought by thousands of new customers every month.
- Write high performance code using the best tech for the job.
- Adhere to engineering best practice across the whole codebase, such as automated testing, continuous integration/deployment and code reviews.
- Constantly iterate on existing functionality and provide new innovative solutions to existing problems. 

## The team

A present, we're a relatively small team of 17 developers that believe in working smart to achieve ambitious goals. Every engineer is expected to be pragmatic in their approach to work, and take initiative to solve the problems they feel are most important, in the way they think is best. Ultimately, we're all problem solvers at heart, and are passionate about using the best technology has to offer to make a product (internal or external) the best it can be.

We don't micro-manage, and put trust in every member of the team to work the way they know they work best. Everyone takes ownership of their projects, adapting and constantly learning new technologies and techniques.

In addition to our London office, many of our teams work remotely. We use Slack to keep in touch, so it's never difficult to find someone to bounce ideas off.

Finally, there's no glass ceiling struggle against - responsibility is there for anyone that wants it.
